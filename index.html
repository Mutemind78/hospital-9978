			<h2>Best Medical & Health care Needs to Our Patients</h2>
			<div class="about-box">
				<div>
					<p>
						Improving patient care has become a priority for all health care providers with the overall
						objective of achieving a high degree of patient satisfaction. Greater awareness among the
						public, increasing demand for better care, keener competition, more health care regulation, the
						rise in medical malpractice litigation, and concern about poor outcomes are factors that
						contribute to this change.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The quality of patient care is essentially determined by the quality of infrastructure, quality
						of training, competence of personnel and efficiency of operational systems. The fundamental
						requirement is the adoption of a system that is ‘patient orientated’. Existing problems in
						health care relate to both medical and non-medical factors and a comprehensive system that
						improves both aspects must be implemented. Health care systems in developing countries face an
						even greater challenge since quality and cost recovery must be balanced with equal opportunities
						in patient care.
